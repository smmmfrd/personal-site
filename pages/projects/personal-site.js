                <p>Next.js to generate a static site, using React as the templating language, is the first step to learning it. As I learn more with Next, this site will continue to improve.</p>

            <ProjectPage.Section title={'Problems'}>
                <p>I couldn't find or figure out a way to convert what I write in plaintext on a document to go through an API into a truly dynamic site that updates when I write, but that's ok. Manually writing out each document allows me to make changes when I need to, like custom stylings or even interactive things.</p>
                <p>This being my first project not being hosted on github pages, finding a hosting platform is also a nightmare, after trying three others out, Netlify does everything I need in a simple package.</p>
            </ProjectPage.Section>
            <ProjectPage.Section title={'Future Plans'}>
                <p>Including more social media links, I have a very small presence online, but supposedly that is a problem with me and not this project. I grew up when social media was becoming a thing, but raised to be wary of posting things online, and while my peers figured out how to get around this dilemma, I never did.</p>
                <p>Most junior devs will include some cool styling, interactivity, animations, or whatever to make their site stand out. Mine is super subtle, but I know I can go even further, and while it would be cool to do something that blows people's minds, I prefer to keep everything fast and quickly accessible.</p>
                <p>A blog section, if I can come up with a few more things to write aboutâ€¦</p>
